# X-Ray-DPC-auto-align

# Dependencies, Equipment, and Setup
  This repository utilizes numpy, scipy, pyUSB, PIL, Tkinter, ThorCam Python API, and the Newport USB Driver for much of the serious implementation of the program. I plan on attaching a text file full of the pip commands necessary to install all necessary dependencies for the project. The equipment needed to perform the alignment are the ThorCam CS895MU, Newport 8742 Motor Controller, 6 Newport 8742 Picomotors, a HeNe laser, a grating, and a fiducial mark. An image of the entire setup will be shown below
