fiducialImageGradientDescent.py

This script is used to implement the functions necessary to perform the
gradient descent which will be used by the motor controller in order to
automatically align gratings. The gradient descent will be based on
two seperate images of radon transforms of the fiducial images, which will
be used as components of a cost function that will be used to implement
the gradient descent.
